# Core knowledge base
knowledge_base = {
    "cement": "Cement is a binding material used in construction. It sets, hardens, and binds other materials together.",
    "concrete": "Concrete is a mixture of cement, sand, aggregates, and water. It is used as a strong building material.",
    "curing": "Curing is the process of maintaining moisture in concrete after it is placed to ensure proper strength gain.",
    "brick": "A brick is a rectangular block made of clay, used for building walls and structures.",
    "steel": "Steel provides tensile strength to concrete structures, commonly used as reinforcement in construction.",
    "aggregate": "Aggregates are granular materials like sand, gravel, or crushed stone, added to concrete or mortar to provide bulk, strength, and stability.",
    "formwork": "Formwork is a temporary mold into which concrete is poured to form structural shapes until it gains sufficient strength.",
    "foundation": "The foundation is the lowest part of a structure that transfers loads from the building to the ground. Types include shallow and deep foundations.",
    "plastering": "Plastering is the process of applying a layer of plaster over walls or ceilings to create a smooth surface for painting or finishing.",
    "masonry": "Masonry refers to the construction of structures from individual units like bricks, stones, or blocks, often bound together by mortar.",
    "rebar": "Rebar, or reinforcing bar, is steel reinforcement used in concrete to improve tensile strength and prevent cracking.",
    "precast concrete": "Precast concrete refers to concrete elements cast in a controlled environment and then transported to the construction site for installation.",
    "scaffolding": "Scaffolding is a temporary structure used to support workers and materials during the construction, maintenance, or repair of buildings.",
    "surveying": "Surveying is the technique of measuring and mapping land to determine boundaries, topography, and layout for construction planning.",
    "waterproofing": "Waterproofing is the process of making structures resistant to water penetration to prevent damage and leaks.",
    "asphalt": "Asphalt is a sticky, black mixture used primarily in road construction and roofing for its durability and water-resistant properties.",
    "beam": "A beam is a horizontal structural element that resists loads applied laterally, helping to support weight in buildings and bridges.",
    "column": "A column is a vertical structural element that primarily carries compressive loads and transfers them to the foundation.",
    "slab": "A slab is a flat, horizontal surface, often made of reinforced concrete, used for floors, roofs, or ceilings.",
    "grout": "Grout is a fluid material used to fill gaps or seal joints between tiles, masonry, or structural elements.",
    "pile": "Piles are deep foundation elements driven into soil to transfer loads from structures to deeper, stable soil layers or bedrock.",
    "retaining wall": "A retaining wall is a structure built to hold back soil, preventing erosion and maintaining level differences in ground elevation."
